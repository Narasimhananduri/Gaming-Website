              <h2>pubg - </h2>
              <p>January 24th, 2020 marked our one-year anniversary since the launch of PUBG LITE Beta Test service in Thailand. As many of you voiced your strong interest in the game, we continued to expand to many regions almost every month throughout 2019. Our primary mission in creating PUBG LITE was to allow more people with various computer environments to access PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS (a.k.a PUBG). Our development team worked hard to bring our players the best qualities of the original game while also coming up with new systems and items exclusive to PUBG LITE. </p>
